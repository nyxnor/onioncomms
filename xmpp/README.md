## Encryption (OTR/OMEMO)?

Read [Off-the-Record Messaging Protocol version 3](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/Protocol-v3-4.1.1.html) by cypherpunks.ca to understand OTR encryption.

* [OTR](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0364.html) does not work with [MUC](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html) (Multi-user chat) but is the most widely used.
